🎮 Word Guessing Game (Python)

This is a simple Word Guessing Game built using Python.
The program randomly selects a word from a list of popular programming languages and technologies (e.g., Python, Java, SQL, HTML, etc.), and the player must guess the word one letter at a time within a limited number of attempts.

📝 How It Works

The game asks for the player’s name and starts with 12 attempts.

A random word is chosen from the predefined list.

The word is displayed as underscores (_) representing hidden letters.

The player enters one letter at a time:

✅ If the guess is correct, the letter is revealed.

❌ If the guess is wrong, the number of attempts decreases.

The game ends when:

The player successfully guesses the word (🎉 You Win).

The player runs out of attempts (😢 You Lose).
